My name is Elius, 
I have been pretty fascinated by computers my whole life and having completed my degree in computer engineering, I am now ready to tackle some bigger projects!

My GitHub is a good place to find a few pieces of work that I have done on the software side of things which is where my interest primarily lies. I eventally plan to create some IOT projects which would likely include hardware design.

Whatever I'm doing in life I like to have to have some project or hobby on the side and this seems to be a good way to keep track of those things. I hope to eventually add some embedded systems programming to the GitHub as.
